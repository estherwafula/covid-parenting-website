                <p style="text-align:justify">The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic presented many challenges for parenting. Parenting was severely
                    challenged by lockdown, school closure, illness, shortages, movement restrictions, and the many
                    sudden changes wrought by the global emergence of COVID-19.

                <p style="text-align:justify">
                    There was clearly a need for rapid and timely responses, and as a result, the COVID-19 parenting
                    tips were generated by a consortium of providers based on evidence-based parenting interventions.
                    These were adapted for online use, with versions in over 100 languages and the possibility for
                    downloading, radio, and oral provision.

                <p style="text-align:justify"><br>
                    The tips were launched in early 2020, and in October 2020, a rapid qualitative evaluation initiative
                    was launched to inform the procedure and drive future provision. Across the study's various arms,
                    global themes related to parenting challenges, the utility of the parenting tips, diverse and
                    complex parenting challenges. The resources were enthusiastically endorsed â€“ showing the receptivity
                    of the audience and the resource gap.

                <p style="text-align:justify">
                    The evaluation provides an insightful analysis of the utility of such tips and how they may evolve
                    to continue meeting parenting needs.
