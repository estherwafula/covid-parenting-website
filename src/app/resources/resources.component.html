        <p>
          To help prevent violence and abuse against children during the COVID-19 pandemic, in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF and other leading agencies, Parenting for Lifelong Health (PLH) provides open-source and evidence-based parenting resources to support parents, caregivers, teachers, nurses, and others in keeping children safe under all circumstances. 
        </p>  
        <br>        
        <p>
          These resources focus on building positive parent-child relationships and reducing violence against children by learning through play, reinforcing positive and managing difficult behaviours, creating structure and routines, talking about COVID-19, keeping children safe online, and reducing stress and conflict.
        </p>
